# Machine learning

## Data handling
70% of the data should be used for training
30% of the data is for testing

In the classifcation data set NULL values will be deleted due to the number of entries
In the regression data set NULL values will be set to the mean for that column

Sklearn should be used to apply feature reduction and PCA when the data is cleaned
